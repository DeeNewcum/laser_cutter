my own thingiverse files for the laser cutter

My files have been tested on [Inkscape](http://paperlined.org/apps/pumping_station_one/laser_cutter/inkscape.html) + Epilog Mini 24, 30 watt.  However they should be easy to use with other software and laser cutters.

The content here tends to focus on papercraft (pepakura) and papercut art (kirigami).
