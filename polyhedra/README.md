This directory contains several polyhedra, organized by type:

* [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid)
* [Archimedean solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid)
* [prisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry)) and [antiprisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiprism)
* [Catalan solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_solid)
* [Johnson solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_solid)

There are three filetypes found here:

* PDO — open in [Pepakura Viewer](http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/download/viewer.html) or [Pepakura Designer](http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/)
* SVG — open in Inkscape, Illustrator, etc
* PDF — suitable for sending to a laser cutter (tested on an Epilog, but should work on others)

For more information on how these were created, see [workflow.html](https://rawgithub.com/DeeNewcum/laser_cutter/master/polyhedra/workflow.html).
